## Unit 3: Ethereum | Local Development Environments -English Version- ðŸš€

### What's this project about?

This project involves creating a simple smart contract, testing it in a local Ethereum development environment using Hardhat, and preparing it for deployment to an Ethereum testnet. The smart contract developed is a `MessageStorage` contract that allows an owner to store and retrieve a string message, with access restricted to the owner. The contract has been deployed to the Sepolia testnet and can be viewed and verified on Etherscan: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xbe48fA9c765F2291387F3C0cDf48D3e4Ff38448E](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xbe48fA9c765F2291387F3C0cDf48D3e4Ff38448E)
